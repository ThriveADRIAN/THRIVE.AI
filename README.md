# Welcome to **ThriveOS** 👋

> In _The Matrix_, the main character [Neo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo_(The_Matrix)  "Neo (The Matrix)") is offered the choice between a red pill and a blue pill by rebel leader [Morpheus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morpheus_(The_Matrix)  "Morpheus (The Matrix)"). Morpheus says "You take the blue pill... the story ends, you wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want to believe. You take the red pill... you stay in [Wonderland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice%27s_Adventures_in_Wonderland  "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland"), and I show you how [deep the rabbit hole goes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Down_the_rabbit_hole  "Down the rabbit hole")."
